## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Activate the Appropriate Mode

Choose the mode that matches your task in Bob:

- **🏛️ Architecture Review** for multi-skill or broad architecture reviews
- **🧭 Spec-Driven Development** for requirements, specifications, and prompt engineering
- **Focused review modes** for a single review domain
- **🔍 Configuration Gap Detector** when current capabilities seem insufficient
- **📋 GitHub Issue Generator** for converting findings and plans into issues

### 2. Request the Task

**Architecture Review**
```text
"Conduct a comprehensive architecture review using all relevant skills"
"Review security, scalability, and 12-factor compliance before production"
```

**Spec-Driven Development**
```text
"Help me define requirements for a new project"
"Review this specification for completeness and testability"
"Turn these notes into structured functional and non-functional requirements"
```

**Configuration Gap Detection**
```text
"Check whether the current Bob configuration is sufficient for this task"
"Identify missing modes or skills for regulated medical software reviews"
```

**GitHub Issue Generation**
```text
"Convert the architecture review findings into GitHub issues"
"Turn this plan into a GitHub issue backlog"
```

### 3. Bob Will

1. Read the relevant mode instructions
2. Read the relevant skill file(s)
3. Apply the documented methodology
4. Produce structured, actionable output

## 🧩 Available Modes

### 1. 🏛️ Architecture Review (`arch-review`)
Orchestrates architecture reviews using reusable review skills.

**Use When**:
- You need a comprehensive review
- You want multiple review areas combined
- You need pre-production validation

### 2. 🧭 Spec-Driven Development (`sdd`)
Supports requirements management, specification creation, and prompt engineering across the SDLC.

**Use When**:
- You need to define or refine requirements
- You want to create or review specifications
- You need prompt engineering support for AI-assisted development

### 3. 🔒 Security & Threat Modeling (`security-review`)
Focused security architecture and threat analysis.

### 4. 📈 Scalability & Performance (`scalability-review`)
Focused scalability and performance analysis.

### 5. 🎨 Architecture Patterns (`patterns-review`)
Focused architecture pattern and design review.

### 6. 🔧 Maintainability & Technical Debt (`maintainability-review`)
Focused maintainability and technical debt analysis.

### 7. 📚 Documentation Review (`documentation-review`)
Focused architecture documentation and diagram review.

### 8. ☁️ 12-Factor Compliance (`twelve-factor-review`)
Focused cloud-native and 12-factor compliance review.

### 9. 🎯 Business Alignment (`business-alignment-review`)
Focused business goals and quality attribute review.

### 10. 🔍 Configuration Gap Detector (`config-gap-detector`)
Detects missing capabilities and proposes new modes or skills.

### 11. 📋 GitHub Issue Generator (`github-issue-generator`)
Converts todo lists, review findings, and SDD requirements into structured
GitHub issues. Use the Python scripts in `../scripts/` for batch operations.
The configured GitHub MCP server is a legacy interactive option whose npm
package is deprecated and should be replaced before production use.
