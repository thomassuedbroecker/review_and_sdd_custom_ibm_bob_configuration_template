# Knowledge Sources for IBM Bob Modes and Skills

## Purpose

This document explains where the knowledge used by this IBM Bob configuration
comes from. It separates:

- **Artifact provenance**: who created or accepted the repository content.
- **Knowledge sources**: standards, frameworks, methods, and product
  documentation that informed the behavior of modes and skills.
- **Runtime source priority**: how Bob should choose between local skills,
  MCP tools, external sources, and model knowledge during a conversation.

The mode and skill files in this repository are maintainer-authored,
AI-assisted configuration artifacts. They are not copied from the referenced
standards or websites. External sources are used as conceptual references and
should be consulted directly when exact wording, certification requirements,
current version details, or license terms matter. License and terms handling
for these resources is tracked separately in
[`RESOURCE_LICENSES.md`](RESOURCE_LICENSES.md).

## Repository Content Provenance

The distributable content is recorded in
[`../../CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md`](../../CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md). In summary:

| Artifact Group | Repository Location | Provenance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bob custom modes | `../custom_modes.yaml` | AI-assisted, authored, reviewed, and accepted by Thomas Suedbroecker |
| Bob skills | `../skills/` | AI-assisted, authored, reviewed, and accepted by Thomas Suedbroecker |
| Bob documentation and notes | `./`, `../notes/` | AI-assisted, maintained by Thomas Suedbroecker |
| GitHub issue scripts | `../scripts/` | AI-assisted scripts maintained by Thomas Suedbroecker |
| Diagrams and images | `diagramms/`, `../images/` | AI-assisted diagram material accepted by Thomas Suedbroecker |
| GitHub MCP dependency | `../mcp.json` | Runtime npm dependency documented in `../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` |

## Runtime Knowledge Priority

All modes should apply this knowledge priority:

1. **User intent and active repository evidence**: the user's current request,
   files, code, docs, tests, configuration, and issue context.
2. **Project-local Bob skills**: files under `../skills/`.
3. **Project-local documentation**: guides under `./`, `guides/`, `diagramms/`,
   and `../notes/`.
4. **Configured tools and MCP sources**: for example GitHub MCP configured in
   `../mcp.json`.
5. **Authoritative external sources**: official product docs, standards,
   specifications, and recognized framework documentation.
6. **General model knowledge**: only when the above sources do not cover the
   task, and with assumptions stated explicitly.

When source currency matters, Bob should use browser or tool-based research
through the Configuration Gap Detector workflow before proposing new skills or
standards-based guidance.

## AI Integration and Usage Source Basis

AI Integration and Usage was added as an SDLC topic to make AI-assisted
development explicit instead of hiding it inside implementation or tooling
tasks. Use this topic when the workflow includes AI coding assistants, models,
agents, MCP servers, prompt assets, generated-code provenance, human review
checkpoints, data-use restrictions, or validation evidence for AI-assisted
outputs.

The topic is grounded in these source groups:

| Source Group | References | How It Informs the SDLC Topic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Bob and SDD product framing | IBM Bob documentation, IBM Bob introduction, IBM Bob launch announcement, IBM Think spec-driven development article | Positions AI assistance as lifecycle work that spans requirements, design, coding, validation, and production readiness. |
| AI governance and risk | NIST AI RMF, NIST Generative AI Profile | Provides the risk-management basis for guardrails, human oversight, data-use limits, and validation evidence. |
| LLM and agent application security | OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications, OWASP ASVS, OWASP Top 10 | Provides security-risk prompts for tool access, prompt injection, data leakage, excessive agency, insecure output handling, and supply-chain exposure. |
| Secure software development | NIST SSDF | Keeps AI-assisted implementation aligned with secure SDLC practices, review evidence, and provenance expectations. |
| Local traceability practice | Requirements Traceability skill, GitHub Issue Traceability skill, Markdown and code-entry conventions | Restricts traceability matrices to GitHub issues, Markdown documents, and code entries in this configuration. |

When adding AI-specific skill behavior, first check whether the existing SDD,
Documentation Review, Security & Threat Modeling, Requirements Traceability,
and Configuration Gap Detector skills cover the request. Introduce a new skill
only when the user needs repeatable work for model evaluation, AI governance,
prompt lifecycle management, agent safety, privacy engineering, or AI supply
chain compliance that cannot be handled by those existing skills.

## Source Trust and Maintenance Rules

| Source Type | Trust Level | Maintenance Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Official standards and specifications | High | Verify exact version before compliance claims |
| Official product documentation | High | Recheck when tool behavior or configuration changes |
| Recognized framework documentation | Medium-High | Use for methodology, not legal or certification claims |
| Vendor or community articles | Medium | Use as supporting context only |
| AI-generated or AI-assisted text | Requires maintainer review | Keep in provenance register and validate against source artifacts |
| General model knowledge | Lowest | Use only when local and authoritative sources do not cover the task |

## License and Terms Boundary

The external references in this document are knowledge sources, not vendored
repository content. They do not change the Apache-2.0 license for repository
files unless material is copied, adapted, translated, or embedded. Before using
external source text beyond citation or short paraphrase, check
[`RESOURCE_LICENSES.md`](RESOURCE_LICENSES.md), update
[`../../CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md`](../../CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md), and preserve any
required attribution or notices.

## Review Findings

### Strengths

- The repository already records artifact provenance in
  `CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md`.
- The custom modes consistently instruct Bob to prefer local skills before
  external tools or general knowledge.
- The SDD and architecture-review areas include a discovery and gap analysis
  skill to clarify lifecycle intent before selecting a skill set.
- The GitHub MCP dependency is documented as a runtime dependency with a
  third-party notice.

### Gaps and Recommendations

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Individual skill files do not all include explicit "Knowledge Sources" sections | Reviewers must infer sources from scattered docs | Keep this file as the central source map and link to it from skill inventories |
| Some framework names are conceptual references without exact version/date | Compliance interpretation may become stale | Verify exact versions before regulated or audit-facing use |
| External resource licenses were previously not mapped next to the mode resources | Reviewers could miss attribution, share-alike, or proprietary-standard boundaries | Use `RESOURCE_LICENSES.md` as the license and terms map for external mode resources |
| The diagram source may not visually show the discovery skill | Visual architecture may lag textual documentation | Update Draw.io and exported PNG when the visual inventory is refreshed |
| Runtime dependency knowledge is separate from mode knowledge | Reviewers need to check multiple docs | Keep `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for dependency licenses and this file for conceptual knowledge |

## Maintainer Checklist for Future Modes or Skills

When adding or changing a mode or skill:

1. Add or update the artifact in `../custom_modes.yaml` or `../skills/`.
2. Record artifact provenance in `../../CONTENT_PROVENANCE.md` when the
   provenance category changes.
3. Add a row in the Mode Knowledge Map or Skill Knowledge Map.
4. Add any new authoritative references to the External Reference Register.
5. Add or update license and terms notes in `RESOURCE_LICENSES.md` for any new
   external resource.
6. Link the new skill from `../skills/README.md` and relevant user guides.
7. Run the Markdown link checker:

```bash
python3 .bob/scripts/check_markdown_links.py .
```
