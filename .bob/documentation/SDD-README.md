## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology that emphasizes creating comprehensive specifications before implementation. It ensures that:

- **Requirements are clear** and well-documented before coding begins
- **Stakeholders are aligned** on what needs to be built and why
- **Quality is built in** from the start through testable specifications
- **Communication is effective** between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Prompts are well-crafted** for AI-assisted development

### Key Principles

1. **Specification-First Approach**: Always start with clear specifications
2. **Holistic Specification**: Cover all aspects (functional, non-functional, constraints)
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Specifications evolve through feedback and validation
4. **Traceability**: Maintain clear links from requirements to implementation

---

## Why SDD Matters

### The Cost of Poor Requirements

Studies show that:
- **40-50%** of software defects originate from poor requirements
- **Fixing a defect** in production costs **100x more** than fixing it during requirements phase
- **Projects with good requirements management** are **97% more likely** to succeed

### Benefits of SDD

✅ **Reduced Errors**: Clear specifications prevent misunderstandings
✅ **Faster Development**: Less rework and clarification needed
✅ **Better Quality**: Testable requirements lead to better testing
✅ **Improved Communication**: Shared understanding among stakeholders
✅ **Cost Savings**: Catch issues early when they're cheaper to fix
✅ **Higher Satisfaction**: Deliver what stakeholders actually need

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using SDD mode, ensure you have:
- [ ] Access to stakeholders for requirements gathering
- [ ] Understanding of the business domain
- [ ] Basic knowledge of the SDLC phase you're working in
- [ ] Familiarity with your project's technical constraints

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Activate SDD Mode** in Bob
2. **Choose your focus**:
   - Requirements gathering
   - Specification creation
   - Prompt crafting
   - Requirements review
3. **Follow the interactive guide** for step-by-step assistance
4. **Use the templates** provided for your specific SDLC phase
5. **Validate your work** using the checklists

---

## Core Components

### 1. Main SDD Mode Prompt (`spec-driven-development.md`)

The main mode prompt provides:
- Comprehensive overview of SDD methodology
- Requirements management guidance
- Specification creation frameworks
- Prompt engineering best practices
- SDLC integration strategies
- Output formats and templates

**When to use**: As your primary reference for all SDD activities

### 2. Requirements Management Skill (`requirements-management-skill.md`)

A specialized skill that covers:
- Stakeholder analysis
- Requirements elicitation techniques
- Functional and non-functional requirements documentation
- Requirements prioritization (MoSCoW, Kano, WSJF)
- Requirements traceability
- Requirements validation and verification
- Change management

**When to use**: When you need deep expertise in requirements engineering

### 3. Requirements Traceability Analysis Skill (`requirements-traceability-skill.md`)

A specialized skill for deeper traceability audits:
- Forward and backward traceability validation
- Orphaned artifact detection
- Coverage metrics and reporting
- Git-based traceability workflows

**When to use**: When basic traceability notes are not enough and you need a
traceability audit or coverage analysis

**Traceability boundary**: Traceability matrices are realized only through
GitHub issues, Markdown documents, and code entries. External ALM systems,
databases, spreadsheet-only trackers, and proprietary traceability repositories
are out of scope unless a dedicated integration is added.

### 4. Interactive Guide (`sdd-interactive-guide.md`)

A step-by-step guide for crafting effective prompts:
- 5-step prompt crafting framework
- SDLC-specific guidelines for each phase
- Real-world examples and templates
- Validation checklists
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

**When to use**: When creating prompts for AI-assisted development

## Best Practices

### For Requirements Management

#### DO ✅
- **Start with Why**: Always understand the business justification
- **Be Specific**: Use measurable, testable requirements
- **Involve Stakeholders**: Get feedback early and often
- **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Not everything can be "must-have"
- **Maintain Traceability**: Link requirements to implementation
- **Document Assumptions**: Make implicit knowledge explicit
- **Use Visual Aids**: Diagrams complement text
- **Review Regularly**: Keep requirements current

#### DON'T ❌
- **Use Vague Terms**: Avoid "fast", "good", "user-friendly"
- **Mix Requirements with Design**: Separate what from how
- **Assume Understanding**: Clarify technical terms
- **Skip Validation**: Always validate with stakeholders
- **Ignore Non-Functional Requirements**: They're critical
- **Let Requirements Stale**: Update as project evolves
- **Forget Edge Cases**: Consider error conditions
- **Work in Isolation**: Collaborate with team

### For Prompt Crafting

#### DO ✅
- **Provide Context**: Background information is crucial
- **Be Explicit**: State constraints and expectations clearly
- **Use Examples**: Show what good output looks like
- **Structure Information**: Use clear sections and formatting
- **Define Success Criteria**: Make "done" measurable
- **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
- **Learn**: Keep a prompt journal for improvement

#### DON'T ❌
- **Be Vague**: Avoid ambiguous language
- **Assume Context**: Don't assume AI knows your project
- **Skip Constraints**: Always state limitations
- **Forget Output Format**: Define expected structure
- **Ignore Feedback**: Learn from results
- **Over-Prescribe**: Allow flexibility in implementation
- **Under-Specify**: Provide sufficient detail

### For Specification Quality

#### DO ✅
- **Make it Testable**: Every requirement should be verifiable
- **Keep it Current**: Update specs as decisions are made
- **Use Consistent Terminology**: Same terms throughout
- **Include Acceptance Criteria**: Define "done" clearly
- **Document Trade-offs**: Explain architectural decisions
- **Version Control**: Track changes to specifications
- **Review with Team**: Get peer feedback

#### DON'T ❌
- **Write and Forget**: Specifications need maintenance
- **Use Inconsistent Terms**: Causes confusion
- **Skip Acceptance Criteria**: How will you know it's done?
- **Hide Trade-offs**: Be transparent about decisions
- **Ignore Version Control**: Track specification evolution
- **Work Alone**: Collaboration improves quality

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: When should I use SDD mode vs. other modes?

**A**: Use SDD mode when you need to:
- Define or clarify requirements
- Create specifications before implementation
- Craft effective prompts for AI-assisted development
- Review requirements for completeness and quality
- Bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation

Use other modes for:
- **Code mode**: When you have clear specs and need to implement
- **Architecture Review**: When you need to validate technical decisions
- **Ask mode**: When you need explanations or documentation

### Q: How detailed should my specifications be?

**A**: Specifications should be:
- **Detailed enough** to be testable and implementable
- **Not so detailed** that they prescribe implementation
- **Appropriate** for the audience and phase

Rule of thumb: If someone unfamiliar with the project can understand what needs to be built and how to verify it, your specification is detailed enough.

### Q: What if requirements change frequently?

**A**: This is normal! SDD embraces iterative refinement:
1. Use change management processes
2. Maintain traceability to understand impact
3. Update specifications promptly
4. Communicate changes to all stakeholders
5. Version control your specifications

### Q: How do I prioritize requirements?

**A**: Use prioritization frameworks:
- **MoSCoW**: Must/Should/Could/Won't Have
- **Kano Model**: Basic/Performance/Excitement needs
- **WSJF**: Weighted Shortest Job First
- **Value vs. Effort**: 2x2 matrix

See [Requirements Prioritization](../skills/requirements-management-skill.md#6-requirements-prioritization) for details.

### Q: Can I use SDD mode with Agile?

**A**: Absolutely! SDD complements Agile:
- Use SDD for sprint planning and backlog refinement
- Create user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- Maintain a living specification that evolves
- Use SDD for definition of ready and done
- Apply SDD to technical spikes and research
