## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Be Specific
Instead of: "Review the system"
Try: "Review security and scalability for production readiness"

### Tip 2: Prioritize
Instead of: "Review everything"
Try: "Focus on security and 12-factor compliance first"

### Tip 3: Iterate
Instead of: "Do all reviews at once"
Try: "Start with security, then we'll do performance"

### Tip 4: Provide Context
```
"Review security for a healthcare application that needs HIPAA compliance"
"Analyze scalability for an e-commerce platform expecting 10x growth"
```

### Tip 5: Reference Skills Directly
```
"Use the security-threat-modeling skill to review authentication"
"Apply the twelve-factor-compliance skill to check our deployment"
"Use the documentation-review skill to check license notices, provenance, and mode/skill evidence resources"
```

### Tip 6: Run Reviews from the CLI (no IDE needed)
```bash
# Full architecture review — output to terminal
automations/run_arch_review.sh --repo <name>

# Focused security review saved to a Markdown file
automations/run_arch_review.sh --repo <name> \
  --mode security-review \
  --out reviews/<name>-security-$(date +%Y%m%d).md

# CI mode — auto-approve, JSON output, token budget cap
automations/run_arch_review.sh --repo <name> \
  --yolo --output json --max-coins 500 --out /tmp/review.json
```
See [`automations/README.md`](../../automations/README.md) for full options and troubleshooting.
