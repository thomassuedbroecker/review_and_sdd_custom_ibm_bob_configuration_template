## Step 3: Common Quick Wins

### Quick Win 1: Transform a Vague Request

**Before** ❌:
```
Create a login page
```

**After** ✅:
```markdown
# Task: User Authentication Login Page

## Context
Building a SaaS application that requires secure user authentication.
Current system has no authentication mechanism.

## Objective
Create a responsive login page with email/password authentication
that integrates with our existing Node.js backend API.

## Requirements
- Email and password input fields with validation
- "Remember me" checkbox
- "Forgot password" link
- Error messages for invalid credentials
- Loading state during authentication
- Redirect to dashboard on success
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility

## Constraints
- Must use React 18+ and TypeScript
- Must integrate with /api/auth/login endpoint
- Must work on mobile and desktop
- Response time < 200ms

## Expected Output
- React component with TypeScript
- Unit tests with >80% coverage
- Storybook stories for all states
- Accessibility audit passing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All form validations work correctly
- [ ] Error handling for all scenarios
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
```

### Quick Win 2: Add Missing Context

**Before** ❌:
```
Fix the performance issue
```

**After** ✅:
```markdown
# Bug Fix: Slow Product Search Performance

## Problem
Product search taking 10-15 seconds, causing user frustration
and cart abandonment. Started after adding full-text search.

## Current State
- Products table: 500,000 rows
- Using PostgreSQL full-text search
- No indexes on search columns
- Database CPU at 90% during peak

## Expected Behavior
Search should complete in < 500ms for 95% of queries

## Root Cause Analysis Needed
- Analyze slow query logs
- Check index usage
- Identify N+1 queries
- Evaluate caching strategy

## Constraints
- Cannot change database (PostgreSQL)
- Zero downtime for optimization
- Must maintain search quality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Search response < 500ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] Database CPU < 50%
- [ ] No degradation in search quality
- [ ] All tests pass
```

### Quick Win 3: Add Acceptance Criteria

**Before** ❌:
```
Users should be able to reset their password
```

**After** ✅:
```markdown
# Feature: Password Reset

## User Story
As a user who forgot my password
I want to reset it via email
So that I can regain access to my account

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm on the login page
      When I click "Forgot Password"
      Then I see a password reset form

- [ ] Given I enter a valid email
      When I submit the form
      Then I receive a reset email within 5 minutes

- [ ] Given I click the reset link in email
      When the link is valid (< 1 hour old)
      Then I see a new password form

- [ ] Given I enter a new password
      When it meets security requirements
      Then my password is updated and I can log in

- [ ] Given the reset link is expired
      When I try to use it
      Then I see an error and can request a new link

## Security Requirements
- Reset links expire after 1 hour
- Links are single-use only
- Password must meet complexity requirements
- Rate limit: 3 requests per hour per email
```

#### Clarity ✅
- [ ] Can someone unfamiliar understand it?
- [ ] Are all terms clearly defined?
- [ ] Is the objective specific and measurable?

#### Completeness ✅
- [ ] Is all necessary information included?
- [ ] Are edge cases considered?
- [ ] Are success criteria defined?

#### Quality ✅

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Being Too Vague
**Problem**: "Make it fast"
**Solution**: "Response time < 200ms for 95% of requests under 1000 concurrent users"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Missing Context
**Problem**: "Create a login page"
**Solution**: Include tech stack, security requirements, integration points, and constraints

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Success Criteria
**Problem**: "Implement user authentication"
**Solution**: Define specific, testable criteria for completion

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements
**Problem**: Only documenting features
**Solution**: Include performance, security, scalability, and usability requirements

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Prioritization
**Problem**: Everything is "critical"
**Solution**: Use MoSCoW or similar framework to prioritize

## Success Tips

💡 **Tip 1**: Start small - Don't try to document everything at once
💡 **Tip 2**: Iterate - Requirements evolve, and that's okay
💡 **Tip 3**: Collaborate - Get feedback from stakeholders early
💡 **Tip 4**: Be specific - Vague requirements lead to vague implementations
💡 **Tip 5**: Keep learning - Review your prompts and improve
