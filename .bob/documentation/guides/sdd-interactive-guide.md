# Interactive Guide: Crafting Effective Prompts for SDLC

## Introduction

This interactive guide helps you craft effective prompts for AI-assisted development throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). By following this structured approach, you'll create clear, comprehensive prompts that lead to better outcomes.

## Why Prompt Quality Matters

**Poor prompts lead to:**
- ❌ Vague or incorrect implementations
- ❌ Missing edge cases and error handling
- ❌ Misaligned with business requirements
- ❌ Wasted time on rework
- ❌ Frustration and confusion

**Good prompts result in:**
- ✅ Clear, accurate implementations
- ✅ Comprehensive solutions
- ✅ Aligned with requirements
- ✅ Efficient development
- ✅ Satisfied stakeholders
